## Block \(Script\)

Blocks are puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in Scratch. The blocks connect to each other vertically like a jigsaw puzzle, where each data type \(hat, stack, reporter, boolean, or cap\) has its own shape and a specially shaped slot for it to be inserted into, which prevents syntax errors. Series of connected blocks are called scripts.

There are ten categories of blocks: Motion, Looks, Sound, List, Event, Control, Sensing, Operators, Variables, and My Blocks. Only nine of these are shown in the Block Palette.

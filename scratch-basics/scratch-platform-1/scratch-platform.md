# Scratch Interface

## How to use the Scratch Interface

* **Blocks:**  Blocks are the building blocks. They are your code.  Blocks are organized into different categories with different colors. 
* **Workspace**: The workspace is where you put your blocks. You attach the blocks together in workspace to build your project.
* **Stage:** You see the actual effect of your code in the stage area. You can see it in full screen or the small screen.
* **Extensions**: Additional extensions can be find from the extension section.
* **Sprites:**  The sprites are your characters/objects that move and interact on the stage. 
* **Backdrops:** The backdrop is the background of the stage. 
* **Backpack:** Your backpack is place you can store blocks or lots of them that can be moved between projects.
